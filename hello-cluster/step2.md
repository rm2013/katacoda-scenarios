Once the Master has initialised, additional nodes can join the cluster as long as they have the correct token. The tokens can be managed via kubeadm token, for example kubeadm token list{{execute}}.

## Task

On the second node, run the command to join the cluster providing the IP address of the Master node.


This is the same command provided after the Master has been initialised.
